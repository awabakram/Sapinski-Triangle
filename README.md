# Sapinski-Triangle
This Python project utilizes the Turtle module to draw a Sierpinski Triangle. The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal pattern composed of equilateral triangles, recursively subdivided into smaller triangles.

# Configuration
You can modify the following variables in the sierpinski_triangle.py file to customize the triangle:

scaler: Determines the size of the triangle.
offset: Shifts the triangle from the origin (0,0).
dotSize: Specifies the size of the dots.
initial_coordinates: Defines the initial coordinates of the triangle vertices.

# Usage
1. Run the Python script as mentioned in the installation steps.
2. The turtle window will appear, displaying the Sierpinski Triangle being drawn.
3. The program will continue drawing the triangle indefinitely until you manually stop it.
